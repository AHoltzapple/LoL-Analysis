With seemingly unending combinations of teammates, champions, abilities, perks, and items, League of Legends matches contain a wealth of interesting statistics regarding a player's performance. The goal of this project is to retrieve my personal match data and explore any trends in my performance across champion types. Ideally this information would help increase my chances of winning a match by understanding which champions I should favor and which I should avoid.
